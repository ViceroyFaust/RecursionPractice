1. What's the simplest possible input? This is the base case
    partition(1, 1) = 1
2. Play around with examples/experiment
    partition(1, 1) = 1
    partition(2, 1) = 1
    partition(3, 1) = 1
    partition(..., 1) = 1
3. Relate hard cases to easy cases

4. Generalize the pattern

5. Write code by combining a recursive pattern with the base case
