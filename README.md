# Recursion Practice
This is my repository for practicing recursion, so I can learn how to think in terms of it and be a better problem solver. Right now I am making the code based off ["5 Simple Steps for Solving Any Recursive Problem"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngCos392W4w).
## Notes from the "5 Simple Steps"
1. What is the possible simplest output?
2. Play around with examples and visualize
3. Relate hard cases to simpler cases
4. Generalize the pattern
5. Write code by combining recursive pattern with the base case
